    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chef Alessandro Gavagna's zlikrofi recipe is an Italian take on the classic dish from Slovenia, which is only a
        short hop over the border from the chef's home in Friuli. Fresh pasta can overcook very easily, so make sure you
        remove the dumplings from the water when they are still firm to the touch to ensure they are cooked perfectly
        and not soggy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <li>
        <ul>500g of flour</ul>
        <ul>4 eggs</ul>
    </li>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <li>
        <ul>30g of butter</ul>
        <ul>30g of lardo</ul>
        <ul>1/2 onion, chopped</ul>
        <ul>50g of pancetta</ul>
        <ul>400g of potatoes, boiled and chopped</ul>
        <ul>2 egg yolks</ul>
        <ul>marjoram</ul>
        <ul>30g of chives</ul>
        <ul>30g of Montasio cheese, plus shavings to garnish</ul>
        <ul>salt</ul>
        <ul>pepper</ul>
    </li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>To make the dough, place the flour in a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Pour in the eggs, mix to
        combine and knead vigorously for at least 15 minutes</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Wrap the dough in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>For the filling, heat the butter in a saucepan and add the onion, lardo and pancetta and cook until the pancetta
        is crispy. Add the potatoes and mix well until a coarse pur√©e is achieved. Leave to cool</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Once cooled, add the egg yolks, salt, pepper, marjoram, chives and grated Montasio cheese. Roll the mix into 10g
        balls and place in the fridge to set</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Roll out the pasta dough on a pasta machine to the lowest setting. Lie the sheet of pasta on the work surface and
        place the balls at 5cm intervals</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Moisten one edge of the pasta and fold it over, sealing at the sides of each ball and at the top. Cut through the
        pasta between each ball to give individual pieces. Make an indentation on the top of each zlikrofi to give a bow
        shape</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Boil the zlikrofi in salted boiling water for 2 minutes then drain in a colander</p>
